=====================
comprehensive and AI-driven assistance with writing a 200-page assignment on the topic of Computer Science | AI Software & Data Science, but with specific requirements that 80% of the content should be rephrased in your own words, and AI-generated content should be limited to 20%. You also need to complete this within 6 hours, with the assignment due on December 17th, 2024.

Here is a Python code to help you with some tasks of this project, such as generating rephrased content using the latest AI models (such as GPT-3.5/ChatGPT), while ensuring the percentage of AI-generated text is kept low. The code will help automate some parts of content rephrasing, saving you time for the 200-page assignment.
Steps to Achieve:

    Gather the necessary content: Use AI to generate summaries, explanations, or portions of content, but ensure that you manually rephrase most of the text to keep it under 20% AI-generated.
    Content rephrasing using GPT: Use OpenAI's GPT model to rephrase or generate content for specific topics.
    Ensure quality: Ensure that the text output is grammatically correct, adheres to the topic, and fits the scope of your assignment.

Python Code for Generating & Rephrasing Content:

import openai
import time

# Set your OpenAI API key
openai.api_key = 'your-openai-api-key'

# Function to rephrase content using GPT-3
def rephrase_content(original_text):
    prompt = f"Rephrase the following text in your own words while keeping the meaning intact: \n\n{original_text}"

    # Call OpenAI's GPT model
    response = openai.Completion.create(
        engine="gpt-4",  # Using the latest model GPT-4 or GPT-3.5
        prompt=prompt,
        max_tokens=500,  # You can adjust the token limit based on the length of your text
        temperature=0.7,  # Setting temperature for creativity
        n=1,
        stop=["\n"]
    )

    rephrased_text = response.choices[0].text.strip()
    return rephrased_text

# Function to get content summary or detail using GPT-3
def get_content_summary(topic):
    prompt = f"Provide a detailed summary of the topic: {topic}. Keep it informative and concise."

    # Call OpenAI's GPT model for content generation
    response = openai.Completion.create(
        engine="gpt-4",  # Latest GPT model
        prompt=prompt,
        max_tokens=1000,  # Adjust according to your content's length
        temperature=0.5,  # Lower temperature for more factual content
        n=1,
        stop=["\n"]
    )

    generated_content = response.choices[0].text.strip()
    return generated_content

# Example usage: Generating a detailed summary
topic = "Artificial Intelligence in Software Engineering"
generated_summary = get_content_summary(topic)
print(f"Generated Summary: \n{generated_summary}")

# Example usage: Rephrasing a section of the text
original_text = "Artificial Intelligence (AI) in software engineering is revolutionizing the way developers build and optimize software systems. AI techniques are increasingly being used to automate tasks, enhance performance, and provide better insights."
rephrased_text = rephrase_content(original_text)
print(f"Rephrased Text: \n{rephrased_text}")

Explanation of the Python Code:

    API Integration: The code connects to OpenAI's GPT model (GPT-3.5 or GPT-4) via the API. The model will assist with rephrasing or generating content based on a provided topic.
    Rephrase Function: The rephrase_content function is designed to rephrase any given text. The output is rephrased to ensure the text is unique but retains the original meaning.
    Summary Generation: The get_content_summary function generates a summary or detailed explanation for a given topic, which is helpful for gathering content from the AI. This will give you a base that you can further elaborate on.

Important Notes:

    Rephrasing: You will need to use the generated content as a base and rephrase 80% of the content in your own words. This ensures that the content generated is original and does not exceed the 20% AI-generated content rule.
    Manual Editing: Ensure that you check all generated content for errors, especially if you need to maintain high quality. AI-generated content should be reviewed to avoid inaccuracies.
    Quality Check: Use AI tools or platforms (e.g., Turnitin or Copyscape) to check the percentage of AI-generated text vs. human-written content. Aim for less than 20% AI content in the final submission.
    Time Management: With only 6 hours to complete the task, focus on generating content for key sections and focus more on the quality of the output rather than quantity.

How to Implement:

    Step 1: Use the get_content_summary function to get detailed summaries for various subtopics related to Computer Science, AI Software, and Data Science. You can input various topics such as “Machine Learning Algorithms,” “Deep Learning,” “AI in Healthcare,” and so on.
    Step 2: Once you have the summary or detailed content from the AI, rephrase 80% of it using your own words. You can then use the rephrase_content function to adjust or polish specific parts.
    Step 3: Once you complete each section, ensure the content flows well, and each part is well-researched and relevant to the topic.

Additional Tips:

    Typing Speed: If you type at 60 WPM or higher, you can manually rephrase sections more quickly. Combine manual efforts with AI assistance to stay on track.
    Content Structuring: For a 200-page assignment, break it down into sections (Introduction, Background, Methodologies, Results, Conclusion). Focus on generating key content and summaries for each section.
    Client Instructions: Always follow the specific instructions given by the client, and ensure all content adheres to academic integrity guidelines.

Budget & Agreement:

Before starting the task, ensure there is clear agreement on the budget and timeline with the client. Given the tight timeline of 6 hours, it's important to set realistic expectations and plan accordingly.
Conclusion:

This Python code will assist you in automating parts of the content generation and rephrasing process, but the bulk of the work will need to be done manually to adhere to the requirement that AI-generated content makes up less than 20% of the final assignment. You should integrate this workflow with your writing process, ensuring quality and adherence to the client’s specifications.
